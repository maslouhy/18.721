  Geometry of solutions to sets of polynomial equations.

  e.g., $x^2 + y^2 + 1 = 0$ $\longrightarrow$ Set of solutions (over $\mathbb C$) is really a sphere (with two points removed)

  e.g., $y^2 = x^3 - x = x(x-1)(x+1)$
  Over $\mathbb C$, the set of solutions is a torus (with one point removed)

  Lots of applications to number theory, representation theory, etc.

  We'll work over the field $\mathbb C$.

  Recall (background reading, \S 10-7, 10-8 in Artin's \emph{Algebra}):
  \begin{thm*}[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz (weak)]
    The maximal ideals of $\mathbb C[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ are exactly those of the form $(x_1 - a_1, \ldots, x_n - a_n)$ corresponding to points $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)\in \mathbb C^n$.
  \end{thm*}

  This means we can consider $\mathbb C^n$ as a purely algebraic object.  It's called affine $n$-space, $\mathbb A^n_{\mathbb C}$ or $\mathbb A^n$ for short.

  We want to define a nice topology on this space.  One choice is to take the Euclidean (complex) topology: define open balls by
  $$B_r(x) = \mathset[y\in\mathbb C^n]{|y - x| < r}$$
  and take these to be a basis.

  But this is too many open sets (closed sets), e.g. $\mathset[(x,y)\in\mathbb C^n]{y=e^x}$ is closed in the Euclidean topology.  But we only care about polynomials, so we'll use a coarser topology (fewer open/closed sets).

  We'll use the smallest topology such that polynomial functions are continuous.  This is called the Zariski topology.  Defined by:
  for a polynomial function $f\in \mathbb C[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, define $D(f) = \mathset[(a_1, \ldots, a_n)\in\mathbb C^n]{f(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \ne 0}$ and declare all $D(f)$ to be open.  (Note: $D$ stands for distinguished.)  As $f$ varies over all polynomials, these $D(f)$ are taken to be a basis.

  We have, e.g, $D(0) = \emptyset$, $D(1) = \mathbb C^n$, $D(fg) = D(f) \cap D(g)$.

  Alternatively, let's see what the closed sets are.  For every ideal $I \subseteq \mathbb C[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, the vanishing locus of $I$ is $V(I) = \mathset[(a_1, \ldots, a_n)\in\mathbb A^n]{f(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = 0\ \forall f\in I}$.  As $I$ varies, these describe all the closed sets in the Zariski topology.

  Note that $\mathbb C^n \setminus D(f) = V(f)$.

  \textsc{Note}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Because $\mathbb C[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ is noetherian\footnote{Every ascending chain of ideals stabilizes: given $I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq R$, $\exists k$ such that $I_k = I_{k+ 1} = \cdots$.  Equivalent to that every ideal is finitely generated}, any $I$ can be written as $(f_1, \ldots, f_k)$ for some $f_1, \ldots, f_k$.  So $V(I) = V(\{f_1, \ldots, f_k\})$.
    \item The maximal ideals (the smallest non-empty closed sets) exactly correspond to the points of $\mathbb C^n$.  (weak Nullstellensatz)
  \end{enumerate}

  e.g.
  \begin{enumerate}[1)]
    \item $\mathbb A^1$: the closed sets are $\emptyset = V(1)$, $\mathbb A^1 = V(0)$, and sets of zeros of polynomials, that is, all finite sets of points.  (also called the cofinite topology)
    \item $\mathbb A^2$: the closed sets are $\emptyset = V(1)$, $\mathbb A^1 = V(0)$, finite sets of points, but also union of $V(f)$ with a finite point set for some polynomial $f\in \mathbb C[x,y]$.

      Why don't we include $V(f, g)$ for $f, g \in \mathbb C[x,y]$?  It's because the locus of points where both $f$ and $g$ vanish (assuming they have no common factor) is a finite set of points.  Note also that $V(f_1) \cup V(f_2) = V(f_1 f_2)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  $\mathbb C[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ is called the affine coordinate ring of $\mathbb A^n$.  (think of it as set of functions on the space $\mathbb A^n$)

  \subsection{Projective Space}
  Claim: $\mathbb A^2$ is somewhat defective.

  Not all lines intersect.  In particular, rotations of one line can cause it to not intersect another line.

  To fix this, we add points at infinity to get $\mathbb P^2$.

  Nice way of doing this: Let
  $$\mathbb P^2 = \left.\mathset{(x, y, z) \in \mathbb A^3\setminus\{0,0,0\}} \right/ (x, y, z) \sim (\lambda x, \lambda y, \lambda z)\qquad (\lambda \ne 0)$$

  $\mathbb A^2$ is contained in the set of points for which $z \ne 0$: If $z\ne 0$, then
  $$(x, y, z) \stackrel{\mathbb P^2}{=} \left(\frac xz, \frac yz, 1\right)$$
  We have $(x, y) \in \mathbb A^2 \longrightarrow (x, y, 1)$.

  $$\mathbb P^2 = \mathbb A^2 \coprod \mathbb P^1 = \mathbb A^2 \coprod \mathbb A^1 \coprod \text{point} (= \mathbb A^0)$$
  Elements of $\mathbb P^2$ are written as $(x:y:z)$.

  Define a topology on $\mathbb P^2$.  Most natural way is to take a quotient topology from the Zariski topology on $\mathbb A^3 \setminus \{0,0,0\} \subseteq \mathbb A^3$.

  Take a polynomial function $f\in \mathbb C[x,y,z]$.  We want to say $V(f) = \mathset[(x:y:z)\in\mathbb P^2]{f(x, y, z) = 0}$ is closed.
  But $f$ gives different values on equivalent points.

  We can write $f = f_0 + f_1 + \cdots + f_d$, $f_i$ homogeneous of degree $i$.
  Then $f(\lambda x, \lambda y, \lambda z) = f_0(x, y, z) + \lambda f_1 (x, y, z) + \cdots + \lambda^d f_d(x, y, z)$.
  We need to take homogeneous polynomials ($f = f_i$ for some $i$).  Now $f = 0$ and $f \ne 0$ makes sense.  Then $V(f_1, \ldots, f_k)$ describe the closed sets.
