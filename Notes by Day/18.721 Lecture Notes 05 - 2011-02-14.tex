  \subsection{Plane curves}
    monomials $m_1, \ldots, m_N$, coefficients $z_1,\ldots, z_N$
    \begin{align*}
      Z & = \text{the space of all homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$ in $x$, $y$, and $z$} \\
        & = \text{affine space with coordinates $z_\nu$}
    \end{align*}
    (We have $f(x, y, z) = z_1x^d + z_2 x^{d-1} + \cdots$)

    $U = $ open subset in $Z$ corresponding to smooth plane curves

    $\mathcal C \subset \mathbb P^2 \times Z$

    $$
    \xymatrix{
    \mathcal C \ar[drr] & \subset & \mathbb P^2 \times Z \ar[d] && \mathcal C|_U = \mathcal C_U \ar[drr] & \subset & \mathbb P^2 \times U \ar[d] \\
                       &         &  Z                           && && U
    }
    $$

    \begin{prop*}
      Smooth plane curves are orientable and connected surfaces, and compact.
    \end{prop*}
    \begin{proof}
      Oreintability was done last time.

      To check connectedness, we just need to check one smooth curve of degree $d$ is connected.  $\mathcal C : \{ x^d + y^d - z^d = 0 \}$.

      Look at the line $y = z$.  On $U_2$, taking $z = 1$ we have $x^d + y^d = 1$.  Since $y = z$, $y = 1$, and then $x^d = 0$.  Since this is a root of order $d$, $C$ meets this line in only one point.  This means that it's connected. (WHY?)
    \end{proof}

    Given a connected, orientable, compact surface, it's topologically characterized by $g = \text{the genus} = \text{the \# of holes}$.

    \begin{defn*}
      The \emph{Euler characteristic} of $C$ is $2 - 2g$.
    \end{defn*}

    The Euler characteristic can be computed used an arbitrary triangulation, and then $E = \text{\# vertices} - \text{\# edges} + \text{\# faces}$.

    A sphere is, topologically, a tetrahedron, we have that the Euler characteristic is $4 - 6 + 4 = 2$.  We can do a similar thing for a torus.

    What is the Euler characteristic and genus of a smooth plane curve of degree $d$?

    Let's represent a smooth plane curve as a branched cover of $\mathbb P^1$.

    \begin{enumerate}[{Method }I]
      \item Start with the Fermat curve, and do an explicit calculation.  $C: \{x^d + y^d - z^d = 0\}$ \\
        Taking $z = 1$, $U_2 \simeq \mathbb A^2 \simeq \mathbb C^2$.  Then we have $x^d + y^d = 1$.  Drop $y$ by projection.
        Fix a value $x_0$ for $x$.  Then the line $y = x_0$ intersects the curve in $\le d$ points.
        Typically, we get $d$ values for $y$.
        \begin{enumerate}[{Case }I]
          \item $x_0^d \ne 1$.  Solve $y^d = 1 - x_0^d$.  There are $d$ solution s (if $y$ is a solution, then so is $yr^{2 \pi i j / d}$ for $0 \le j \le d$)
          \item $x_0^d = 1$.  Solve $y^d = 0$.  The only solution is $y = 0$. Now we look at $x_0$.  Triangulate $\mathbb P^1$, which is a sphere, as follows.  There are $d$ values for $x_0$, $x_i^d = 1$, $x_i = e^{2\pi i j / d}$.
      \begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{2011-02-14_Diagram_001}\end{center}
          These points distribute themselves along the equator of $\mathbb P^1$.  Adding points at the poles, there are $2 + d$ vertices, $d + d + d = 3d$ edges, and $2d$ faces, which gives us 2. This is what happens ``downstairs'' (in the projected curve onto $X = \mathbb P^1$).\\
          Upstairs, there is an induced triangulation:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item vertices: $d + d + d = 3d$
            \item edges: $3d^2$
            \item faces: $2d^2$
          \end{itemize}
          Then the Euler characteristic is $E = 3d- 3d^2 + 2d^2 = 3d - d^2 = d(3 - d)$.  Then $g = \frac12(d - 1)(d - 2)$.
        \end{enumerate}
      \item Let $C$ be a smooth curve of degree $d$.  Assume the coefficient of $z^d$ is not zero.  Divide by that coefficient, giving $f(x, y, z) = z^d - a_1(x, y) z^{d-1} + \cdots \pm a_d(x, y)$.  Homogenous polynomial $\implies$ $a_i(x, y)$ is degree $i$ in $x$ and $y$.  Then drop $z$ by projection onto $\mathbb P^1(x, y)$.

        Fix $(x_0, y_0)$.  View $z^d - a_1(x_0, y_0) z^{d-1} + \cdots \pm a_d(x_0, y_0) = 0$ as a polynomial of degree $d$ in $z$.  Typically this has $d$ roots, but for some values of $(x, y)$, there are $d-1$ roots.

        There is a polynomial $\Delta$, discriminant, degree $d(d - 1)$ in $x$ and $y$.  $\Delta = 0$ iff there are less than $d$ roots.  (The discriminant for a quadratic is $b^2 - 4ac$.  It tells you whether or not the polynomial has double roots.)  (Note, if the discriminant has only simple roots, then the claim above (that there are only $d$ or $d - 1$ roots at any point) is intuitively/geometrically true.)

        Triangulate $X = \mathbb P^1$ by putting vertices at these $d(d - 1)$ points.  For $\mathbb P^1$, the Euler characteristic is $2$.  Pulling the triangulation up, the Euler characteristic is approximately $2d$ (everything gets multiplied by $d$).  However, we placed the vertices at the $d(d - 2)$ points where there are $d - 1$ roots.  Then the Euler characteristic is $2d - d(d - 1) = 3d - d^2$.
    \end{enumerate}
